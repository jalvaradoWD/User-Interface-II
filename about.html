        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My first interest in my career didn't start out on programming and
          especially web development. It started out in animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was always amazed on how animated movies how you can make a
          character move in any way you want it to. Having a character express
          their feeling, displaying emotions, and all around movement of the
          characters is fun to look at. Some day I would like to animate a
          character or make a passion project in animation.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I have a background on programming when I was 18. It started out as a
          hobby where I got interested in building my own simple little
          webistes. As time went on I got more invested in programming. I tried
          out Python, C, a bunch of JavaScript and Javascript libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm studying under Lambda School to sharpen my skills as a
          programmer. Althoug I'm confident in my skills in programming,I
          beleive that there is much more to learn. There is a limit on how one
          person self-teaching themselves how to code.
